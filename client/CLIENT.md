# CHAOS ARENA – Frontend 2D Game Architecture

## 1️⃣ Frontend Philosophy

The frontend is responsible for:

✔ Rendering smooth 2D gameplay  
✔ Handling client-side prediction  
✔ Interpolating remote players  
✔ Managing room connections  
✔ Rendering real-time leaderboard  
✔ Supporting multiple games modularly  
✔ Running smoothly on mobile & desktop

The frontend NEVER:
❌ Decides authoritative game results  
❌ Trusts local physics permanently  
❌ Calculates final score

Server is always authoritative.

---

# 2️⃣ Tech Stack

Core:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- KAPLAY (Kaboom.js)
- Colyseus JS Client

Optional UI:

- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand (lightweight state management)

---

# 3️⃣ Folder Structure

client/

├── src/
│ ├── games/
│ │ ├── grass-collect/ (Currently Active)
│ │ │ ├── GameArena.tsx (Canvas-based rendering)
│ │ │ └── constants.ts
│ │ │
│ │ └── hot-dynamite/ (Planned)
│ │ ├── ArenaLogic.ts
│ │
│ ├── components/
│ │ ├── Lobby.tsx (Multiplayer Room Selection)
│ │ ├── Leaderboard.tsx (Global & Match History)
│ │ └── PlayerStats.tsx (Browser-persistent stats)
│ │
│ ├── services/
│ │ └── gameClient.ts (Colyseus networking & Ngrok bypass)
│ │
│ └── App.tsx (Entry point & Identity management)

Each game mode is a self-contained logic within `GameArena.tsx` or a modular sub-folder.
The current implementation uses a Canvas-based HUD-less approach with Framer Motion UI overlays.

# 4️⃣ Core Architecture Layers

## A️⃣ Rendering Layer (HTML5 Canvas)

Responsible for:

- Player characters (Pixel art SVG/Base64)
- Arena objects (Grass, Dynamite, Explosions)
- Particle systems for VFX
- Smooth interpolation (client-side prediction)
- Viewport scaling (Fixed 800x600 logical arena)

## B️⃣ Networking Layer (Colyseus)

Managed via:
`client/src/services/gameClient.ts`

- Room creation (`arcade`)
- State synchronization (Players, Grass, Scores)
- Ngrok bypass headers for external access
- Unique `playerId` persistence via LocalStorage

core/network.ts

Responsibilities:

- Connect to Colyseus room
- Handle join/leave
- Listen to state patches
- Send player input only

Client NEVER sends:
❌ Position
❌ Score
❌ Game results

Only sends:
✔ Direction
✔ Jump
✔ Action key

---

## C️⃣ Client-Side Prediction

File:
prediction.ts

Flow per frame (60 FPS):

1. Capture input
2. Apply movement locally
3. Send input to server
4. Render predicted position

This ensures smooth gameplay.

---

## D️⃣ Server Reconciliation

When authoritative state arrives:

1. Compare local predicted position
2. If mismatch:
   - Snap if large difference
   - Smoothly lerp if small difference

Never allow drift.

---

## E️⃣ Interpolation (Other Players)

Server sync rate: 20–30Hz  
Client render rate: 60Hz

For remote players:

- Store previous state
- Store next state
- Interpolate between frames

Ensures smooth remote movement.

---

# 5️⃣ Game Scene Structure (Example: Arena)

ArenaScene Responsibilities:

✔ Spawn player
✔ Render arena modules
✔ Detect visual collisions
✔ Handle camera
✔ Display HUD
✔ Trigger local effects on server events

Server Event Example:

{
type: "spawn_trap",
x: 400,
y: 200
}

Frontend:

- Spawn visual trap
- Play sound
- Animate effect

Physics authority still server-side.

---

# 6️⃣ Input Handling

Desktop:

- WASD / Arrow Keys
- Space for jump

Mobile:

- Virtual joystick
- Tap to jump

Input abstraction layer:

input.ts

This ensures both mobile & desktop use same core logic.

---

# 7️⃣ Leaderboard UI

Source:
Redis → Colyseus → Client

Frontend:

- Receives leaderboard update event
- Renders sorted list
- Updates in real-time

HUD shows:

- Player rank
- Score
- Alive count
- Match timer

---

# 8️⃣ Multi-Game Switching

Flow:

1. User selects game in Lobby
2. Connect to specific room type
3. Load matching scene
4. Start simulation

Example:

if (gameType === "arena") {
kaplay.go("arena")
}

Each game:

- Has isolated logic
- Shares network layer
- Shares prediction system

---

# 9️⃣ Performance Strategy

Target:

60 FPS on:

- Desktop
- Mid-range mobile

Optimization Rules:

✔ Avoid heavy sprite assets
✔ Reuse objects
✔ Avoid full scene re-renders
✔ Use diff-based state updates
✔ Avoid excessive React re-renders

React handles UI only.
Game rendering stays inside KAPLAY.

---

# 🔟 Mobile Optimization

✔ Fixed joystick zone
✔ Simplified particle effects
✔ Reduced shadow effects
✔ Touch-friendly UI
✔ Large buttons

Test on:

- Mid-range Android
- iPhone Safari

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ WebSocket Lifecycle

On Join:

- Connect
- Authenticate
- Join room
- Load scene

On Disconnect:

- Show reconnect overlay
- Attempt rejoin
- Clean up scene if failed

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Animation & Effects Layer

Used for:

- Player elimination
- Arena mutation
- Trap spawn
- Victory screen

Keep effects lightweight.

Do NOT use heavy shader effects for hackathon.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ Error Handling Strategy

Handle:

- Room full
- Invalid JWT
- Server disconnect
- Desync correction

Display friendly overlay instead of crashing scene.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ Hackathon Mode Simplification

Build first:

✔ Arena game only
✔ Basic prediction
✔ Basic interpolation
✔ Leaderboard UI
✔ Clean HUD

Add later:

- Multiple games
- Advanced animations
- Spectator mode
- Replay system

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ Final Frontend Guarantees

✔ Smooth 60 FPS gameplay  
✔ Authoritative server sync  
✔ Client-side prediction  
✔ Clean modular multi-game support  
✔ Real-time leaderboard updates  
✔ Mobile & desktop compatibility

---

# Final Philosophy

Frontend should feel:

Smooth.
Responsive.
Predictive.
Visually chaotic.
Network-stable.

Let the backend decide truth.
Let the frontend make it beautiful.
