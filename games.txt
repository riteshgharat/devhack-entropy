=========================================
CHAOS ARENA – MINIGAME CATALOG
=========================================

Mode 1: HOT DYNAMITE (Refined)
-----------------------------------------
An AI-driven elimination brawl where speed and spatial awareness are survival.

Players enter the arena as customizable Pixel Stickmen. The match is overseen by a sadistic AI Game Master who initiates the chaos. At the start of each round, a 'Hot Dynamite' is forcefully attached to one random stickman.

CORE MECHANICS:
- THE PASS: Move into another player to transfer the dynamite.
- THE COUNTDOWN: A visible timer (rendered via Canvas VFX) ticks down overhead. The timer decreases faster as players are eliminated.
- DETONATION: When the timer hits zero, the dynamite explodes (Full-screen ScreenShake + PixelFire particles), eliminating the holder instantly.

AI CHAOS INTERVENTIONS:
- THE SLIP: The AI may grease the arena floors, increasing drift and making it harder to pass.
- BOMB SPAWNS: Secondary decoys appear to confuse players.
- SPEED BOOSTERS: Golden tiles appear to help players escape—or chase.

VICTORY:
The last stickman remaining is crowned 'Arena Champion' and receives a global leaderboard boost.

-----------------------------------------

Mode 2: GRASS COLLECT (Standard Mode)
-----------------------------------------
A high-energy collection sprint where the AI Game Master tinkers with the laws of physics.

Players scramble to gather glowing 'Grass' tiles (Resource Nodes) spawned across the arena. Each collection adds to the score, but every tile gathered brings the AI closer to a 'Chaos Pulse'.

CORE MECHANICS:
- THE SPRINT: High-speed movement across a 800x600 arena with momentum-based physics.
- THE NODES: 50+ nodes appear in waves. Some nodes provide 'Powerups' (Speed Booster, Shield, Stun Bomb).
- THE COUNTER: A 60-second survival clock. The player with the highest collection total wins.

AI CHAOS INTERVENTIONS:
- THE STORM: AI periodically pulls all players toward the center or pushes them to the edges.
- STUN LOCK: AI targets the leader with stun frames to allow others to catch up.
- GRAVITY SHIFT: Temporary inversion of movement controls.

VICTOR:
The stickman with the highest 'Grass Total' at zero seconds wins. Points are immediately synced to the global SQLite leaderboard.

-----------------------------------------

Mode 3: STAY ALIVE (Chaos Tiles)
-----------------------------------------
A high-tension multiplayer survival challenge where the very ground beneath your feet is out to get you.

Players are trapped on a pixelated grid that is constantly monitored by the AI Game Master. Every few seconds, the AI picks random 'Victim Tiles' that flip from safe to lethal.

CORE MECHANICS:
- THE GRID: A 15x15 tiled arena (logical 800x600 layout) that flashes to indicate danger.
- THE COUNTDOWN: A pulsating tile overlay warning players of an imminent 'Chaos Blast'.
- THE ELIMINATION: Being caught on an active 'Bomb Tile' results in instant 'Vaporization' (Canvas-based VFX).

AI CHAOS INTERVENTIONS:
- THE SHUFFLE: The AI Game Master swaps tile states at the last second to confuse 'Pros'.
- ICE FLOORS: Friction is reduced, making it difficult to stop on a single safe tile.
- BLIND ARENA: The AI blacks out the screen except for a small viewport around the player during a blast phase.

VICTORY:
The last stickman remaining is crowned the 'Void Survivor'. Winning boosts the rank on the SQLite Global Leaderboard.
